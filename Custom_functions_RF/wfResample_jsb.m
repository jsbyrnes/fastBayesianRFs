% inTraces, outTraces are irisFetch type structures of arrays
% newSR is the desired sampling rate in sps.
% in outTraces all the .data will have the same number of samples
% the fields sampleCount and sampleRate will be updated accordingly.
% I should add a comment saying the traces were resampled.
% any traces that are shorter than what they are supposed to be, will be
% axed.

%loop through traces and resample as needed

%     %more formal but double filters the data
%     oldSR1 = round(outTraces(k).sampleRate*1000); %keep 3 decimals
%     newSR1 = round(Parameters.sample_rate*1000);
