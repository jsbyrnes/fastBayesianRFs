function [ time_series ] = delay_continuous( time_series, fs, delay)
%delay_continuous Applies a time shift of delay to time_series in the
%frequency domain. Almost works perfectly but there is a small imaginary
%component coming out so I am doing something wrong, most likely related to
%how fftshift is being used. 
    
    undo = 0;

    %you need time_series to be odd
%     if mod(length(time_series), 2) == 0
%     
%         time_series(end + 1) = 0;
%         undo                 = 1;
%         
%     end
        
    if length(fs) == 1
    
        dFreq = fs/length(time_series); %frequency spacing
        
        fNyq=fs/2;   %Nyquist frequency
        
        %the next two steps build the frequency vector (freqs at which spectrum
        %was calculated) postivie and negative
        f=(0:length(time_series)-1)'*dFreq;
        f(f>fNyq)=f(f>fNyq)-fNyq*2;

    else

        f = fs;

    end
    
    %f = linspace(-1*fs/2, fs/2, length(time_series));
    
    Ftime_series = fft(time_series);
    Ftime_series = Ftime_series .* exp (-1 * 1i * 2 * pi * f * delay);
    time_series  = real(ifft((Ftime_series)));
    
    if undo
        
        time_series = time_series(1:end-1);
        
    end
    
end
